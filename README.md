# Overview

This is my MODULE #5, The goal is to use tow esp8266 modules to allow the creation of a remote wireless lan that could
be used to send and receive signals from the second esp module. This project is meant to transfer into a remote controller
and a wireless receiver which would send sensorry information back and ford between both modules. 
However, although I was able to connect both modules, I'm still working on the process of sending and receiveiving special instructions
and thus, I was not able to achive my ultimate goal.
